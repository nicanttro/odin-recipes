# ODIN RECIPE PROJECT

This project is apart of The Odin Project's foundation curriculum. It's used to exercise and put to use the knowledge I've learned and will learn going forward.

The recipe project html setup so far is a simple homepage with links to 3 recipe pages. The recipe pages all have a picture of the cooked recipe, with alt descriptions. The recipe pages also include proper use of headers, using paragraphs as well as ordered and unordered lists.
